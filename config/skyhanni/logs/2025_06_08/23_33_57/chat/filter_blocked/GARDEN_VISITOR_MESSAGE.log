00:02:21 §e[NPC] §aXalx§f: §r§fHello gardener, I've been looking for some sugar to grow my new crop. Wanna try it?
00:02:24 §e[NPC] §aXalx§f: §r§fDarn humans, you don't understand how to use things...
00:02:26 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
00:02:30 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI helped you enter the Crystal Hollows so many times! Why won't you return the favor?
00:02:30 §e[NPC] §aRoyal Resident§f: §r§fMy neighbor told me to get off his property, but he doesn't even own this place!
00:02:33 §e[NPC] §aRoyal Resident§f: §rMaybe I have to talk to the King about him. He is going too far. I think the current King is §l§6Emkam§f.
00:02:34 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fIt seems like my brew selection is rather small...I've recently heard that melon juice is really sought after so maybe it can enhance my drinks' flavors!
00:02:36 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fWell done! I'm sure that even Sirius will enjoy my revolutionary melon refreshments.
00:02:36 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
00:02:39 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fMy standing as the King's favorite emissary is secured as soon as I bring these back home!
