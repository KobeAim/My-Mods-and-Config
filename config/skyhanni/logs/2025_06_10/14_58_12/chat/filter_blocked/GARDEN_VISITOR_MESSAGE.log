15:23:10 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fHey, you got some wheat for my pets by any chance? Gotta keep those little monsters fed, haha!
15:23:12 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fOh, you're out of wheat? Alright, I'll come back later then.
15:23:13 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Golden Carrot §ffor me.
15:23:15 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
15:23:15 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
15:23:18 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fMy standing as the King's favorite emissary is secured as soon as I bring these back home!
15:23:19 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §rIt's Monday, my resting day! I earned myself a little treat, maybe you could bring me some chocolate?

15:25:22 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fThe King made me go grocery shopping. Me! Can you believe that? He has a pair of perfectly good legs, and still, here I am.
15:25:24 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fI bet when I am back, they are all still sitting around that table! All day, every day! It's ludicrous!
