23:00:13 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
23:00:14 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fAmazing! Thanks for taking the time! Now, time to finish my Cactus Trap...and hopefully it boosts my pelt earnings.
